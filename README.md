# NextBite
Farmers markets often have produce at the end of the day that isnâ€™t sellable, either due to visual imperfections or overproduction, which contributes to food waste. Volunteers from non-profit organizations rescue food from farmers markets, but this process is inconsistent due to ineffective communication between volunteers and vendors. NextBite is a mobile application that streamlines the donation process by allowing vendors to create donation listings to inform volunteers about the availability of surplus food, which volunteers can then rescue and distribute to non-profit organizations.
